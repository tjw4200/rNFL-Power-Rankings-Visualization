# Introduction

Reddit is a great place for sports fans. News, gamethreads, analysis, highlights, and much more are posted and broken down by fellow fans. It is a huge community-driven collection that satisfies any sporting fan needs, and serves as an excellent supplement to ESPN, Bleacher Report, and the like. The [/r/NFL](www.reddit.com/r/NFL) subreddit is a perfect example of a great community. 

Like nearly every popular sports website out there, Tuesday morning means NFL power rankings, where analysts rank teams 1-32 based on how good they are. Whether it be ESPN's 'power panel' of rankers, 538's ELO ranking methodology, or Bleacher Report's one man show, power rankings are a great place to gauge how your team is doing. 

But what about the community? Well, /r/NFL has their method too. Each week, 32 representatives, one from each team's fanbase, create their own power rankings which are aggregated and posted to the community, with each representative writing a little blurb on their feelings of the team week by week. These rankings are then discussed within the community, where fans are free to cheer, complain, and sometimes all out argue over their team's rankings. Even the rankers are available to defend their sometimes outlandish decisions, like why /u/whirledworld ranked the Jaguars #3 in Week 5. 

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/75ismt/official_rnfl_week_5_power_rankings/) are the Week 5, 2017 /r/NFL power rankings. 

Now, while this is a great way to view the /r/NFL power rankings, there's so much going on behind the scenes that we aren't seeing from this write-up alone.
