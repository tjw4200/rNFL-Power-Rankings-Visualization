# rNFL-Power-Rankings-Visualization

## Intro
Every Tuesday during the NFL regualar season, the /r/NFL subreddit posts power rankings for NFL teams for the current week. 32 rankers (one representative from each team) rank the teams 1-32 and the results are compiled into the final power rankings. This project brings some cool visualizations to the mix like line plots and boxplots to get a better idea of how the rankers feel about the teams. 

## Files involved
The only extra file needed is the nfl_color_codes.csv that I wrote which includes the primary and secondary colors of each team. Everything else is pulled from reddit.
